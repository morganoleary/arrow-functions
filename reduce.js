// curr = currentValue : current array item the callback function is being run on

//console.log(sum); 
// Prints: 
// Accumulator: 0 Current Value: 1 Total: 1
// Accumulator: 1 Current Value: 2 Total: 3
// Accumulator: 3 Current Value: 3 Total: 6
// Accumulator: 6 Current Value: 4 Total: 10
// 10 (the ultimate value returned as the 'sum')
// (the accumulator is "accumulating" the sum of the current values as the function is executed for each element)

// Simplified down to one line again with the accumulator set as 0:ÃŸ
